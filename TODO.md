- [ ] Support implicit type conversions for structs via operator overloads
- [ ] Support binary, octal & hexadecimal numbers

- [ ] Template to generate syntax file for sublime text from grammar
- [ ] Proper structured bindings for pattern matching
- [ ] Guarantee copy elision
- [ ] Proper sublime_text tooling
